## End to End Data Engineering Project on Azure
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete **data engineering pipeline** using **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**, **Azure Databricks**, **Apache Spark**, **Power BI**.  
The goal of the project is to build a scalable and automated data pipeline that ingests raw data from the source, stores it securely in a data lake, transforms it using Spark-based processing, and makes it available for analytics and reporting.  
This project follows a multi-zone architecture (Raw → Transformation → Curated) and showcases cloud-based orchestration, distributed data processing, and best practices in data engineering on Azure.
